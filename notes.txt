ยง3:   @charset rules must be before all other characters except an optional BOM
      Charset is apparently a string, e.g. `@charset "ISO-8859-1";`
      Valid charsets are listed here:
          http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets

ยง4.1: Everything under CSS's control is case insensitive
      This doesn't include font names, ids, classes and element names
      Element names are case sensitive with XHTML
