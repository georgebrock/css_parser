# A Ruby CSS parser

This gem is a Ruby CSS parser built using [Treetop][tt] and the
[grammar from the CSS 2.1 specification][grammar].

It's currently not very well tested, so any errors in the original grammar or
introduced when transposing the grammar into Treetop syntax are unlikely to
have been caught.
